# Biology-Themed Project: Bacterial Movement and Populations

## Topic

This project models how different bacterial species move and proliferate under specific nutrient or stress conditions.

The data come from simulated bacterial tracking experiments. Each simulation contains information about the number of bacteria observed, their 3D momentum (`px`, `py`, and `pz`), and an ID corresponding to a specific bacterial strain or genetic variant.

The bacterial strains included in the dataset are:

- E. coli WT and E. coli mutant
- Bacillus subtilis WT and Bacillus subtilis mutant
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa WT and antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Streptococcus pneumoniae and capsule-deficient Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis
- Salmonella enterica and Salmonella mutant

## Research Questions

The project aims to answer the following questions:

1. What are the average counts of each bacterial strain and their statistical uncertainties?
2. Is there an asymmetry between the normal and mutant bacterial strains? If so, how large?
3. Is there an asymmetry between the normal and mutant bacterial strains as a function of their momentum?

## Analysis

The full sample contained 5,000,000 events and was divided into 10 sub-samples of 500,000 events, each of which was analysed separately. In total, 4,614,632 valid events were used in the analysis.

An event was considered valid if it contained at least one of the 12 bacterial IDs included in the analysis. Empty events and events containing no recognised bacterial IDs were excluded.

The 10 files were analysed separately. For each bacterial strain, the total number of bacteria was counted and divided by the number of valid events in that file.

The average abundance for each strain in each file was calculated as:

$$
\text{Average abundance} = \frac{\text{Number of bacteria}}{\text{Number of valid events}}
$$

The final average for each strain was calculated as the mean of the 10 sub-sample averages using `np.mean()`.

The statistical uncertainty was estimated using the sub-sampling method, by calculating the sample standard deviation of the 10 sub-sample averages using `np.std(..., ddof=1)`.

For example, the average abundance of wild-type E. coli was calculated by counting all bacteria with ID 211 in each file and dividing by the number of valid events. The mean of the 10 results was 19.9640, with a standard deviation of 0.0328.

## Results

The average number of bacteria per valid event and the statistical uncertainty for each strain are shown below.

| Bacterial strain | Average per valid event | Statistical uncertainty |
|---|---:|---:|
| E. coli (wild type) | 19.9640 | ± 0.0328 |
| E. coli (mutant) | 19.9317 | ± 0.0319 |
| B. subtilis (wild type) | 2.5110 | ± 0.0048 |
| B. subtilis (mutant) | 2.5053 | ± 0.0055 |
| P. aeruginosa (wild type) | 1.2089 | ± 0.0019 |
| P. aeruginosa (mutant) | 1.1850 | ± 0.0024 |
| S. pneumoniae (wild type) | 0.27680 | ± 0.00108 |
| S. pneumoniae (mutant) | 0.27189 | ± 0.00099 |
| M. tuberculosis (wild type) | 0.03947 | ± 0.00028 |
| M. tuberculosis (mutant) | 0.03903 | ± 0.00040 |
| S. enterica (wild type) | 0.001188 | ± 0.000042 |
| S. enterica (mutant) | 0.001152 | ± 0.000051 |

## Wild Type vs Mutant Comparison

To compare the wild-type and mutant strains, the difference in their average abundances was calculated separately for each of the 10 sub-samples:

**Difference = WT average - mutant average**

The final difference was calculated using `np.mean()` on the 10 differences. The sample standard deviation of the 10 differences was calculated using `np.std(..., ddof=1)` and used as the statistical uncertainty.

For example, for E. coli:

19.9640 - 19.9317 = approximately 0.0323

The final result was **0.03232 ± 0.00452 bacteria per valid event**.

The uncertainty was calculated from the 10 individual WT-mutant differences rather than subtracting the uncertainties of the two strains.

| Bacterial strains | Mean difference per valid event | Statistical uncertainty |
|---|---:|---:|
| E. coli WT vs mutant | 0.03232 | ± 0.00452 |
| B. subtilis WT vs mutant | 0.00570 | ± 0.00330 |
| P. aeruginosa WT vs mutant | 0.02389 | ± 0.00237 |
| S. pneumoniae WT vs mutant | 0.00491 | ± 0.00058 |
| M. tuberculosis WT vs mutant | 0.000441 | ± 0.000488 |
| S. enterica WT vs mutant | 0.0000355 | ± 0.0000686 |

All six species showed a positive mean difference, meaning the wild-type bacteria were slightly more abundant than their corresponding mutants.

However, for M. tuberculosis and S. enterica, the differences were small compared with their statistical uncertainties.

## Asymmetry as a Function of Momentum

The final part of the analysis investigated the difference between wild-type and mutant bacteria and how it changes depending on their momentum.

The analysis focused on E. coli and S. pneumoniae.

### Calculating Momentum

For each bacterium, the total momentum was calculated from its three components:

$$
p = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}
$$

The momentum values were divided into bins between 0 and 60, with E. coli having a bin width of 1 and S. pneumoniae a bin width of 2.

Different bin widths were used because E. coli was much more abundant than S. pneumoniae.

The momentum values are expressed in units of 10^-20 kg m/s.

### Calculating the Asymmetry

For each momentum bin, the number of wild-type and mutant bacteria was counted separately in each of the 10 files.

The difference was then calculated so that the final graph shows the mean WT-mutant difference across the 10 sub-samples.

$$
D = \frac{N_{WT} - N_{mutant}}{10}
$$

Here, N represents the total number of bacteria counted in that momentum bin across all 10 files.

A positive difference means that more wild-type bacteria were observed than mutants.

### Statistical Uncertainty

Following the feedback received after our presentation, Poisson uncertainties were used for the momentum histograms instead of the standard deviation across the 10 sub-samples.

Since the histogram bins contain bacterial counts, the uncertainty of a count N was calculated using:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{N}
$$

For the difference between two independent counts, the uncertainties were combined:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{N_{WT} + N_{mutant}}
$$

Since the graph shows the mean difference across 10 sub-samples, the uncertainty was divided by 10:

$$
\sigma_{\text{mean}} = \frac{\sqrt{N_{WT} + N_{mutant}}}{10}
$$

These uncertainties were displayed as error bars using `plt.errorbar()`.

For example, if one momentum bin contained a total of 10,000 wild-type bacteria and 9,000 mutant bacteria across the 10 files, the mean difference would be:

(10,000 - 9,000) / 10 = 100

The Poisson uncertainty would be:

sqrt(10,000 + 9,000) / 10 = approximately 13.78

The result would therefore be approximately 100 ± 13.78.

This is a hypothetical example showing how the calculation works.

### Momentum Analysis

For E. coli, the WT-mutant difference was largest at the lowest momentum bins. As momentum increased, the difference generally decreased.

A similar pattern was observed for S. pneumoniae.

The error bars represent the Poisson uncertainty of the mean count difference in every momentum bin.

## Discussion

The results show that wild-type bacteria were generally more abundant than mutant bacteria in the simulated dataset, with E. coli showing the largest absolute difference in average abundance.

The momentum analysis showed that the WT-mutant difference was not constant across momentum but showed larger differences at lower momentum, which generally decreased as momentum increased.

However, the momentum graphs show absolute differences in bacterial counts. Since the total number of bacteria also changes with momentum, a smaller difference at higher momentum does not necessarily mean that the relative asymmetry becomes smaller.

A normalized asymmetry could be investigated in future work.

## Conclusion

The analysis answered the three research questions by calculating the average abundance of each bacterial strain, comparing wild-type and mutant strains, and investigating how their differences change with momentum.

Overall, wild-type bacteria were slightly more abundant than their corresponding mutants.

For E. coli and S. pneumoniae, the largest WT-mutant count differences were observed at lower momentum, with the differences generally decreasing as momentum increased.

The statistical uncertainties were estimated using the sub-sampling method for average abundances and overall differences, and Poisson uncertainties for the momentum histograms.
